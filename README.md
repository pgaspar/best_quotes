# Best Quotes

A very simple app using my very simple Rails clone, [Tails](https://github.com/pgaspar/tails). Based on the Rebuilding Rails book.

The last time I worked on this was in 2019, but I'm trying to get back to it 👍

**Note:** `tails` is not available on rubygems, so this app only works if you also clone the [tails](https://github.com/pgaspar/tails) repo.
